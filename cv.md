Hello everyone, my name is Kristina , I'm 24 and I've recently become a mother and this is the main achievement in 2019 and in general:)
I consider that maternity leave is a good time for new activities and self-development.
The decision to learn .NET wasn't spontaneous. Several years ago I started my career of software testing engineer in EPAM, where I had some experience in testing, communicating.
I've also learned the way everything in IT sphere works, discovered some project management methods. 
Concerning the question of education, I graduated from GSU Skorina university(Gomel), department of Foreingn Languages and I'm a teacher of English. 
My English level is Upper Intermediate. 
And , finally, the main goal in TMS is to learn how the developer world works. As a creative person I'd like to be able to carry the idea into code.
